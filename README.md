## App Architecture

OBS: .env file is needed to run project, and is not supplied through the `git clone` command.

```
.env                # Environment variables, supplied by @devmattb.
.app.yaml           # Google Cloud deploy container settings.
public              # All static and public assets, such as images and videos.
src
│   start.js        # App start file
│   app.js          # App entry point
└───api             # Express route controllers for all the endpoints of the app
└───config          # Configuration for environment variables
└───loaders         # Splits up the startup process into modules
└───models          # Database models
└───services        # All the business logic is here
```

**Keep in mind that we often group files in to the following categories:**

```
any_folder
└───both          # Both client and server-needed files
└───client        # Only client-side needed files
└───server        # Only server-side files
```
